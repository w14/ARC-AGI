multimodal vision?</h1>
<p>Sadly, photo realism—that is, photos of real objects instead of
synthetic computer-generated drawings, don’t seem to improve multimodal
capabilities.</p>
<p>Claude can see squares in a synthetically generated image:</p>
<p><img src="img/claude_color_grid.png" /></p>
<p>But a hand drawing gives the wrong answer:</p>
<p><img src="img/claude_color_grid_real.png" /></p>
<p>This may be because there are no borders between the squares. Claude
really struggles with synthetic images without borders—just a grid of
colors without space between.</p>
<p>I had hoped that it could get the hand drawing right, and this would
enable it to do ARC-AGI because ARC requires seeing pixels
<em>together</em> as a single shape.</p>
